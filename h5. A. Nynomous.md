•	Exploits historically targeted Tor Browser Bundle or user mistakes.

•	Firefox exploit led to Freedom Hosting takedown but was patched.


•	Tor can't hide if both sides are monitored.

•	Tor's core cryptography remains strong, attacks involve browser flaws or user errors.



2.	Tor is not only used by criminals 


•	Tor is not exclusively used by criminals, it serves various purposes.

•	Activists, the military, families, and journalists use Tor for security reasons.


•	Tor provides anonymity and helps protect against certain criminal tactics.

•	Using Tor doesn't inherently aid criminals, similar to using the Internet.




3.	Tor does not have a military backdoor


•	Tor was initially funded by the US Navy but has no military backdoor.

•	Audited by several very smart cryptographers and security professionals, Tor's open-source code is transparent.


•	It is dedicated by a team of activities who prioritizes privacy and anonymity while working on Tor.




4.	No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay


•	Running a Tor relay in the US hasn't led to lawsuits or prosecutions.
•	Operating a Tor relay is likely not illegal under US law, but law enforcement contact may still occur, especially for exit relays.

•	The EFF is confident in the legality, even running its own Tor relay.


•	If Tor is used for criminal activities, it may lead to legal issues and increased scrutiny, negatively affecting the public.




5.	Tor is easy to use

•	Tor is not difficult to use for privacy, by downloading Tor Bundle or with Tails operating system that runs on a DVD or thumb drive, it offers user-friendly option. 

•	Tails is a live operating system that routes your entire internet connection through Tor and erases data upon shutdown. 


•	The Tor Browser Bundle comes pre-configured for secure Tor browsing.





6.	Tor is not as slow as you think


•	Tor is slower than a regular internet connection, but ongoing efforts have improved its speed.

•	Increasing the number of relays is a keyway to enhance Tor's speed.


•	Those interested in helping can contribute to the Tor network's speed by participating in the Tor Challenge.





7.	Tor is not foolproof


•	Tor is not flawless, and users can compromise their anonymity with incorrect usage.

•	Use Tor Browser Bundle or Tails and keep software updated for effective anonymity.


•	Services like Google and Facebook can still see your communications when using Tor to access their platforms.

•	Adversaries with access to both sides of your connection may perform statistical analysis.


•	Tor is robust anonymity software, and dispelling misconceptions is essential for informed use.

Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser 




subchapters: 

 Introduction

•	Tor, based on Firefox, is a significant tool for anonymous Internet use.

•	It hides the user's IP address, making tracing or identification very difficult.


•	Tor offers both ease of use and effective anonymity, accessible to virtually anyone.

•	It's one of the simplest and freely available ways to browse the Internet anonymously.







History and Intended Use of The Onion Router

•	Tor aims to enable unfettered and anonymous internet communication.

•	It allows access to blocked websites by oppressive governments, anonymous whistleblower communication, and private business conversations.


•	Like a versatile tool, Tor can be used for both legitimate and illicit purposes.

•	Initially developed by the US government but now not under its control.


•	Open for global contributions and improvements, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness.

•	Ironically, the US government, which created Tor, is researching methods to deanonymize its users.






How The Onion Router Works


•	Tor routes a user's internet traffic through random relays.

•	Data is encrypted with elliptic curve cryptography, highly resistant to brute-force attacks.


•	Encryption layers are progressively removed at each relay (entry, middle, exit).

•	The exit relay establishes an unencrypted connection to the user's target.






Tracking Criminals Using TOR

•	Tracking Tor users is challenging, and many government agencies aim to deanonymize them.

•	Few high-profile successes were often due to suspects' errors, not Tor vulnerabilities.


•	Access to federal resources for investigating Tor users is impossible, unless linked to terrorism cases.

•	Investigators often lack National Security Agency support for Tor-related cases.









a)	Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

I start the installation by downloading the file from (https://www.torproject.org)
I choose the Linux file. after downloading, I extracted it into a new folder, and I created new file in documents directory then I did the launching from the terminal as shown below.
