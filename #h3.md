• Threat modeling manifesto

Threat modeling is like a structured investigation into the security and privacy risks of a system. It's a bit like playing detective by asking four important questions: What are we trying to protect? What could possibly go wrong and harm our system? How are we planning to defend against these potential issues? And finally, did we do a thorough job in safeguarding our system?

This process is crucial for spotting problems in how a system is designed and built, so we can fix them before they cause trouble. Anyone who cares about the safety and privacy of a system should do threat modeling.

The Threat Modeling Manifesto is like a set of guiding principles. It tells us to prioritize finding and solving design problems instead of just checking boxes for compliance. It encourages teamwork and constant improvement. It also suggests using different ways to look at problems and solutions, being practical rather than perfect, and avoiding the mistake of relying too much on one person to solve everything or getting lost in the small details.



• Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course  
Shostack discusses threat modeling in the videos, emphasizing the importance of sketching, collaboration, asking questions regarding security, and recording threat modeling work.

In Video 7, the discussion focuses on data flow diagrams because they are heavily associated with threat modeling, as threats tend to follow data. These diagrams have five symbols in them: external entities, which are anything outside your control, like an app; processes, which represent any running code under your control, data flows which connect them and we use little drums to represent where data is stored. The last element is the trust boundary, where we show that different elements are operated by different entities with different people and processes.



• Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model!

"Threat Modeling: Designing for Security, Chapter 1, Diving in and Threat Modeling," Explains with examples how to implement the four key questions in practice:

1.	What are you building?
2.	What can go wrong?
3.	What should you do about those things that can go wrong?
4.	Did you do a decent job of analysis?

Threat modeling is a valuable skill that can be learned by any technical professional. It involves combining two models: one for potential issues (threats) and another for the software being developed or deployed, represented in a diagram. 

The STRIDE model, which covers:

Spoofing is pretending to be something or someone you're not.
Tampering is modifying something you're not supposed to modify. It can include packets on the wire (or wireless), bits on disk, or the bits in memory.
Repudiation means claiming you didn't do something (regardless of whether you did or not).
information disclosure. is about exposing information to people who are not authorized to see it.
denial of service are attacks designed to prevent a system from providing service, including by crashing it, making it unusably slow, or filling all its storage.
elevation of privilege is when a program or user is technically able to do things that they're not supposed to do.



• Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identify and prioritize potential threats, with guidance for both new and existing systems. It's for everyone in software development, not just security experts, and can save resources when applied early.

When creating a threat model:
1.	Analyze data flow for vulnerabilities.
2.	Document potential threats thoroughly.
3.	Note security measures for mitigation.

This approach works for both systems and applications. Threat agents are those capable of executing threats, and understanding their capabilities and motivations is essential. Impact measures potential harm, while likelihood assesses the probability of a threat. Controls come in two forms: "preventions" stop threats, while "mitigations" reduce their impact. Data flow diagrams and trust boundaries help visualize information flow and trust transitions in the system.


a) Security hygiene. What basic security practices should everyone follow?

fundamental security practices that everyone should follow:

1.	Strong and Unique Passwords.
2.	Multi-Factor Authentication. Enable MFA wherever possible, especially for sensitive accounts like email and online banking.
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second authentication   method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone.
3.	Regular Software Updates. Software updates often include patches to fix known security vulnerabilities.
4.	Beware of Phishing Emails: Be cautious when opening emails from unknown or suspicious sources.
Don't click on links or download attachments from untrusted emails.
Verify the sender's identity if you receive unsolicited requests for sensitive information.
5.	Secure Browsing Habits: Use secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) when browsing websites, especially when entering personal information or making online payments. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted websites.
6.	Firewall and Antivirus Software. Install reputable firewall and antivirus/anti-malware software on your devices.
            Regularly update and run scans to detect and remove malware.
7.	Data Backup. Regularly back up important data to an external device or a cloud storage service. Ensure that backups are secure and accessible in case of data loss or  ransomware attacks.
8.	Privacy Settings. Review and adjust the privacy settings on your social media profiles and online accounts.
9.	Safe Wi-Fi Practices. Use strong and unique passwords for your Wi-Fi network.
Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks without using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for added security.
10.	Physical Device Security. Keep your devices physically secure and lock them when not in use.
Don't leave laptops or mobile devices unattended in public places.




b) Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.




In a rapidly evolving digital world, where cybersecurity threats lurk around every corner, establishing a new hotel company presents both opportunities and challenges. Our hotel company, "SecureStay Hotels," aims to provide a seamless and secure experience for our guests while optimizing our operations through innovative technology. To achieve this, we recognize the critical need for a threat model that encompasses all aspects of our business.

1. What are we working on?

At SecureStay Hotels, we are working on creating a modern hotel chain that leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and safeguard sensitive information. Our key assets include:

Customer Personal Information: This is our crown jewel. Protecting our guests' data is paramount. Any breach of their personal information could lead to legal consequences, loss of reputation, and financial repercussions.
Reservation and Booking System: Ensuring the integrity of our reservation system is essential to prevent revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.
Payment Processing: Secure and reliable payment processing is critical. Any compromise in this area could result in financial losses and damage to our reputation.
Physical Security: Protecting our guests, employees, and property is essential. Security systems, access control, and surveillance fall under this category.
Online Presence: Maintaining the security of our website, mobile app, and social media accounts is crucial to safeguard our digital brand.
Security directly supports our business goals by ensuring the trust and safety of our guests. Below is a simplified diagram of our company systems:

2. What can go wrong?

To identify potential threats, we will employ the STRIDE model, which categorizes threats into six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

•	Spoofing: Unauthorized access to the reservation system or website by an attacker impersonating a legitimate user, potentially leading to data breaches or fraudulent bookings.
•	Tampering: Manipulation of booking data, payment transactions, or customer records, which can result in financial losses or legal liabilities.
•	Repudiation: Guests denying they made certain bookings or payments, leading to disputes and potential financial losses.
•	Information Disclosure: Unauthorized access to customer data, payment information, or sensitive internal documents could lead to data breaches and legal consequences.
•	Denial of Service: Attackers disrupting our reservation system or website, rendering them unavailable to customers and causing revenue loss.
•	Elevation of Privilege: Unauthorized access to administrative functions or employee accounts could lead to unauthorized actions and data breaches.

High-priority risks include data breaches, website defacement, and payment processing vulnerabilities. These risks have a high expected value due to their potential impact on customer trust and financial losses.

Additionally, we need to consider the threat actors. While all hotel businesses are susceptible to generic cyber threats, specific threat actors could target us, such as financially motivated cybercriminals or industrial espionage by competitors. Understanding their capabilities, opportunities, and intent is crucial.



3. What are we going to do about it?

To mitigate the identified risks, we will employ a combination of strategies:

•	Reduce Attack Surface: Implement strict access controls, two-factor authentication, and robust encryption to minimize opportunities for attackers.
•	Limit Entry Points: Reduce the number of access points to critical systems to limit potential vulnerabilities.
•	Continuous Monitoring: Implement intrusion detection systems, regularly update security patches, and conduct frequent security audits.
•	Employee Training: Educate employees about security best practices to reduce the likelihood of insider threats.
•	Third-Party Security: Vet and monitor third-party service providers (e.g., payment processors) for security compliance.
•	Incident Response Plan: Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to minimize damage in case of a security breach.


4. Did we do a good enough job?

Regular security audits, penetration tests, assessments, and continuous threat modeling will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our security measures. We will stay informed about emerging threats and adapt our security practices accordingly. The goal is not just to meet industry standards but to exceed them to ensure the safety and trust of our guests.

In summary, Secure Stay Hotels recognizes that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of our business model. By implementing a comprehensive threat model and proactive security measures, we aim to provide our guests with peace of mind while staying at our hotels and secure our place in the competitive hospitality industry.
