              Z) LastPass password manager.

Threats it Protects Against:

•	Password Reuse: It encourages the use of strong, unique passwords for each online account, reducing the risk of password reuse.
•	Password Theft: LastPass encrypts and securely stores passwords, reducing the likelihood of passwords being stolen.
•	Phishing: It can automatically fill in login credentials only on legitimate websites, helping users avoid phishing scams.
•	Brute Force Attacks: LastPass employs encryption and strong security measures to guard against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks.



Information Encryption:

LastPass encrypts sensitive information such as passwords, notes, and payment card details using strong encryption algorithms. This information is securely stored in a user's vault.
What's not encrypted are the user's master password and certain non-sensitive account information that is required for LastPass functionality, like the names of websites and usernames.

License:

LastPass offers both a free and a paid version. The paid version is known as LastPass Premium.
The license categorizes users based on their subscription type (e.g., Free, Premium, Family) and the associated features and capabilities.






Data Storage:

LastPass provides users with the option to store their data either locally or in the cloud.
When stored in the cloud, LastPass servers are used, but the specific location of these servers may vary. LastPass has servers in multiple regions, including the United States and Europe.
The choice of data storage location may also depend on the user's selected server region or data center.

Data Protection:

LastPass employs robust encryption and hashing techniques to protect user data.
Data is encrypted on the user's device before it's sent to LastPass servers, and only the user has the decryption key (master password).
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available for added security.
LastPass has a strong security track record and undergoes regular security audits.
